    "# Classical approach to model harmonic  motion\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start a first approach from a classical point of view. Imagine that we have two atoms (masses: $m_1$ and $m_2$, whose values, for the moment, are equal: $m_1$=$m_2$ ) joined by a spring of spring constant $k$, we can actually use Hook Law to derive the force and the field force that each atom experiences:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F= m \\frac{\\partial^2 R(t) }{\\partial t^2 }= \\nabla_R V(R)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we solve integrate to obtain the force field, we obtain the so called harmonic potential. In this way, the harmonic potential $V(R)$ can be expanded in Taylor series around the equilibrium position $R_0$ (also called relaxation position):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V(R) = V_0 + \\frac{\\partial V }{\\partial R }|_{R=R_0}(R-R_0)+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 V }{\\partial R^2 }|_{R=R_0}(R-R_0)^2+...\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and we found that the third term is the spring constant $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This set of equations allow us to understand that a molecule is not a rigid body! but is vibrating around a equilibrium position. What is more, the spring is the virtual bond that keeps interacting the two atoms at a defined frequency. This example can easily describe a $H_2$ molecule, since this one is composed of two equivalent atoms. We can challenge this theory to understand the vibration nature of other molecules, for instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can learn about the strength of the bond (which parameter we have to change to simulate a simple bond, a double or a triple bond?)\n",
    "* We can guess what happen if now the mass of the masses is too much different, can we talk about the vibrations in heteromolecules (such as HCl) or even more amazing:\n",
    "* Can we know how having an isotopic atom changes the vibrational motion? \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore some of this questions using a generic solution for the harmonic motion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x   = x_0+C_1sin(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}t)+C_2cos(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From this equation we can easily identify two important terms: the vibrational frequency ($\\nu$) and the reduced mass ($\\mu$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nu = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi }\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}  ; \\        \\  \\mu = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1+m_2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important parameter is the amplitude of the oscillation $A(\\omega_f)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A=\\frac{F_0/\\mu}{\\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2-\\omega_f^2)^2+4\\omega_f^2γ^2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This parameter is useful to see the impact of different variables in the system. These variables can be the following ones:\n",
    "* How the change of the media in which the compound is can affect the oscillation: this can be simulated with $\\gamma$, which in the harmonic motion correspond to a damped harmonic oscillator.\n",
    "* We can also see how the natural frequency of oscillation $\\omega_0$ get displaced by the change in mass or string constant.\n",
    "* Finally, if we plot $A(\\omega_f)$, we can see how the maximum get modified and also $\\omega_0$, since a definition of this last one is where the maximum amplitude of oscillation takes place."
